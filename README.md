## Vaccine Adverse Reaction Data
[Licensed under the MIT License]

A project to parse and investigate public data on adverse reactions to vaccinations.

This is an exercise for me in understanding Python data structures and ETL patterns. Hopefully it will turn into something more.

Note on the scripts: vax.py is an early version playing with pandas and pycurses and will probably be removed. vax2.py is the current working version and should be the one you test with.

To try it out for yourself ...

Obtain VAX data zips at:

Usage eg:

	./vax2.py --file ./2015VAERSData.zip
