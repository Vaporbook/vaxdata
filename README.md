## Vaccine Adverse Reaction Data
[Licensed under the MIT License]

A project to parse and investigate public data on adverse reactions to vaccinations.

This is an exercise for me in understanding Python data structures and ETL patterns. Hopefully it will turn into something more.

To try it out for yourself ...

Obtain VAX data zips at:

	https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/data

Usage eg:

	./vax2.py --file ./2015VAERSData.zip
